The Corona Api is copied from the Corona forum and started by the user PixelEnvision. List will be updated when it is possible.

Lime autocomplete is still work in progress and is not complete with the entire lib, some of them behave strange when used while some work. I don't know why that is.

Issues with LevelHelper list.
PubNub is just a test.

CoronaUI (Ansca Official lib) is written from the Reference Docs, please refer to the official documents for further info on what they do and how to use.

These files were written with a lot of Copy/past so there might be some or many errors.....

If you find any errors please let me know.

Follow me on twitter for updates.
