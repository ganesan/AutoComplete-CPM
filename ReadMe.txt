Lime autocomplete is still work in progress and is not complete with the entire lib, some of them behave strange when used while some work. I don't know why that is.

Issues with LevelHelper list.
PubNub is just a test.

CoronaUI (Ansca Official lib) is written from the Reference Docs, please refer to the official documents for further info on what they do and how to use.
