Use AutoCompleteListCombined when adding to CPM. the .lua file extension is just used for syntax color and have no other purpose.

The Corona Api is copied from the Corona forum and started by the user PixelEnvision. List will be updated when it is possible.

Lime autocomplete is still work in progress and is not complete with the entire lib, some of them behave strange when used while some work. I don't know why that is.

Issues with LevelHelper list.
PubNub is just a test.

These files were written with a lot of Copy/past so there might be some or many errors.....

Follow me on twitter for updates.
